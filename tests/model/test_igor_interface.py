    Parameters
    ----------
    options : list
        A Python nested ordered list with each value being a command/option.
        White spaces will seperate the options. Note: the depth of the
        nested lists will determine the number '-' characters to add in
        front of the first element for each list.
    expected : str
        The correctly formatted commandline string.

    Raises
    -------
    AssertionError
        If the performed test failed.
